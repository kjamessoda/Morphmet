# __Morphmet Mailing List__
Welcome to Morphmet! Morphmet is one of the oldest and most trusted resources for practioners of geometric morphometrics, the study of biological shape through Procrustes-based methodologies (_i.e.,_ the Procrustes paradigm). Since it's creation, Morphmet has had two major missions: 1) To facilitate communication between users and developers of geometric morphometric methods, and 2) To increase access to resources related to geometric morphometric methods, especially for researchers in areas that would otherwise struggle to find those resources (_e.g.,_ those in low- and middle-income countries).
