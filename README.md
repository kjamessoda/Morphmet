# __Morphmet Mailing List and Forum__
Welcome to Morphmet! Morphmet is one of the oldest and most trusted resources for practioners of geometric morphometrics, the study of biological shape through Procrustes-based methodologies (_i.e.,_ the Procrustes paradigm). Since it's creation, Morphmet has had two major missions: 

1) To facilitate communication between users and developers of geometric morphometric methods. 
2) To increase access to resources related to geometric morphometric methods, especially for researchers in areas that would otherwise struggle to find those resources (_e.g.,_ those in low- and middle-income countries). 

We are happy that you are here.

## Subscribing to Morphmet
__This page is not the mailing list or forum__; it just describes Morphmet in a more accessible location. Morphmet is currently administered through Google Groups. You can find instruction on joining a Google Group at the following website: https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205?hl=en. Here are some things to keep in mind as you go through the process of joining:

1) You will need a Google Account to find and join Morphmet. Instructions on creating a Google Account can be found at this website: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en

2) As you would expect, the group name is Morphmet, so search for Morphmet when you access Google Groups. 

3) To minimize the distribution of spam and malicious emails, Morphmet is a moderated group. This means that when you first click on the group, it will tell you that you do not yet have permission to enter. Click "Ask to Join the Group." You will be provided access shortly after (usually within 24 hours).

4) You may interact with Morphmet as either a mailing list (_i.e.,_ messages will be sent directly to your email inbox) or as a forum (_i.e.,_ you will access the group as a website and read messages there). You always have the option to use the group as a message board, but when you join, you are provided with options on how you would like to receive email notifications, if at all.

Alternatively, you should also be able to join by emailing morphmet2+subscribe@googlegroups.com.

## Posting to the Group
To post messages to the group, send an email to morphmet2@googlegroups.com. 

While formulating your messages, please keep the following points in mind:

1) Morphmet is centered on morphometric research, so messages to the group should also center on research-related topics. Common topics for messages include:

     a) Announcements of new morphometric software, updates to existing morphometric software, and new morphometric publications.
     
     b) Questions about the theory and applications of geometric morphometrics, including questions related to software.
     
     c) Job and course announcements for morphometricians.
     
   Morphmet predominantly focuses on geometric morphometric methods, but we also discuss traditional morphometrics (_i.e.,_ linear measurements) from time to time as well.

2) Morphmet uses English as its _lingua franca_. __However, messages are never rejected based on the quality of the author's English, so please do not let language concerns deter you.__ So long as it is clear that the message is about morphometrics, then the message is suitable.

3) We are all here because we are passionate about morphometrics, and sometimes our passion can cause conversation to become heated. Nonetheless, please consider the feelings of others when writing your messages and try to keep your messages professional and cordial. Morphmet needs to be a safe space for its users if it is going to be able to fulfill its mission. If you have concerns about any posted message or conversation, please reach out to the moderator (see Contact Information for the Moderator below).

## Your First Posting 
Your first message to the group will be moderated; in other words, the moderator will need to approve it before distribution. This provides one last safeguard against malicious emails.

In _extremely_ rare occassions, the moderator may consult with you regarding whether your message fits the scope of the group (see Posting to the Group above) and how to make your message fit the scope better. This is very much intended to be a consultation. I have helped to administer this group since 2011, and to the best of my knowledge, no message has ever been outright rejected unless it appeared to be spam or malicious.

## Contact Information for the Moderator
Do you have additional questions or concerns about the group? Please feel free to reach out to the moderator. The acting moderator is:

K. James Soda

On behalf of all Morphmet members, we look forward to having you and look forward to your first post.
